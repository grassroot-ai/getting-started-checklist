# Grassroots AI - Getting Started Checklist

This is a growing checklist on how to start a distributed collaborative grassroots AI movement. It is by no means complete (in fact, this is just a first pass) and is forever changing as different groups include their learnings. Each movement would need to adapt to their individual CONTEXT. That said, we hope some people find value from this

## Rationale

There is a growing set of initiatives that want to enable AI research in a participatory and inclusive fashion. To name a few [Masakhane](https://masakhane.io), [ML Collective](https://mlcollective.org), [Sisonke Biotik](https://www.sisonkebiotik.africa/), [Delta Analytics](https://www.deltanalytics.org/) and [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/). 

The activities recommended in the check list are grounded in the following values:
- Collaboration
- Inclusivity
- Ownership
- Kindness
- Scalability
- Robustness
- Sustainability. 
 
They've largely been evolved in low-resourced environments for volunteer base activities.
