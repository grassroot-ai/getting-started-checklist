# Grassroots AI - Getting Started Checklist

This is a growing checklist on how to start a distributed collaborative grassroots AI movement. It is by no means complete (in fact, this is just a first pass) and is forever changing as different groups include their learnings. Each movement would need to adapt to their individual CONTEXT. That said, we hope some people find value from this

## Rationale

There is a growing set of initiatives that want to enable AI research in a participatory and inclusive fashion. To name a few [Masakhane](https://masakhane.io), [ML Collective](https://mlcollective.org), [Sisonke Biotik](https://www.sisonkebiotik.africa/), [Delta Analytics](https://www.deltanalytics.org/), [Turkic Interlingua](https://turkic-interlingua.org/) and [BigScience](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/). 

The activities recommended in the check list are grounded in the following values:
- Collaboration
- Inclusivity
- Trust
- Kindness
- Scalability
- Robustness
- Sustainability 
- Multidisciplinarity
 
They've largely been evolved in low-resourced environments for volunteer base activities. 

**Note: Currently the checklist is skewed to the principles used within the Masakhane and Sisonke Biotik initiatives. This means it's likely skewed to the African context**

## The Check List

### Direction and Momentum

- [x] **Articulate a long term vision**. This is a simple and accessible articulation of why you're organising together. 
- [x] **Initial Collaborative Task**. This task should lower the barrier to entry. 
- [x] **Initial Announcement Event**. This event serves to spread the word and recruit participants. It is recommended to co-locate this event in a space where their might be a higher density of potential participants, for example: a conference. 
- [x] **Scheduled Regular Catch up Meetings**. This 

### Collaboration Mediums

- [x] **Synchronous Communication**. A chat platform should be chosen that is familiar to the multidisciplinary stakeholders. This could be anything from Whatsapp groups to Slack to Discord to Teams.
- [x] **Asynchronous Communication**. Not everyone has capacity to keep up with ongoing chats, so an asynchronous communition medium, such as a google mailing list, is excellent for important announcements and discussions.
- [x] **Meeting Platform**. The meeting platform is exellent for regular catch up calls 
- [x] **Open and Accessible Meeting Notes**. No meeting time is accessible for all timezones or availabilities. Thus, open and accessible meeting notes are ideal for people to follow.
- [x] **Open Calendar**. All events related to the movement should be included on an open calendar. People can easily subscribe to the calendar and be informed about all events

### Inclusivity

Inclusivity requires lowering barriers to entry, but also helping guide newcomers, and grow each others expertise

- [x] **Simple and Welcoming Onboarding**. Make joining the movement and getting access to initial points to start as simple as possible. Avoid requesting lots of details from your participants. e.g. Requesting level of education might make an individual without a traditional scientific education feel less welcome. 
- [x] **Orientation for Newcomers**. Provide an overview of where the movement is at the beginning on each meeting and give anchor points for new participants to start partipating. Having an initial message with some tips to get started also helps significantly. 
- [x] **Platform Familiarity**. Consider the accessibility and familiarity of chosen platforms. e.g. Not all disciplines use the same tools, and to achieve multidisciplinarity one may need to choose something less suitable that is more accessible. e.g. Meeting notes on Github (a platform for developers) versus a simple Google Doc (which more people can use).
- [x] **Peer and Group Mentorship Culture**. Peer mentorship acknowledges that each individual has something they can teach another, and Group mentorship provides space for anyone to ask questions and for the members to help each other. Having channel dedicated to people getting help and answering questions is helpful.

### Robustness, Sustainability and Scalability
- [x] **Redundancy in Leadership**. Given these sort of movements are typically part-time, they need to be robust to changes in availability in leadership.  Multiple community leaders that are given the power to unblock others, will allow for the necessary ebbs and flows in 
- [x] **Trust and Ownership**. When people have an awesome idea on how to make the movement better, provide them with the tools and access so that they can own the initiative. Additionally, trusting others means less bottlenecking and reliance on early leadership, and allow
